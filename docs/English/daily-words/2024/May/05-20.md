Hunter John set out early one cold morning for his daily patrol. His task was to monitor the conduct around the village, ensuring that no illegal activities were taking place. He knew his job was important because any improper conduct could lead to serious consequences.

Recently, a problem had arisen in the village: many young people were struggling with an addiction to a new drug. This addiction not only made it difficult for them to work but also caused a lot of distress for their families. To address this issue, John and the other villagers decided to take action to transfer the young people's attention away from the drug and help them overcome their addiction.

The village had limited resources, and the quota for supplies was tight. Therefore, everyone had to use resources sparingly and avoid waste. Despite the insufficient resources, everyone worked together, hoping to inhibit the spread of this addiction.

After many discussions, the villagers decided to suspend all unnecessary activities temporarily and focus all their efforts on this issue. They also came up with some affordable entertainment options, hoping to attract the young people and help them find new interests.

John knew that solving this problem would take time and patience, but he believed that if everyone worked together, they could overcome even the seemingly omnipotent challenge. Eventually, their village would return to peace, and everyone could live happily.
