#### 正文

In a remote village, there was a **formation** (fɔːrˈmeɪʃən) of unusual rocks that the villagers believed had magical properties. One day, a group of explorers arrived with the goal to **flatten** (ˈflætən) a path through the rocks to make it accessible. However, the rocks were incredibly **unwieldy** (ʌnˈwiːldi), making the task difficult.

Among the explorers was a man named John, known for his persistence. He often said, "This job is **weird** (wɪrd), but it must be done." With their tools, they **packed** (pækd) their equipment carefully, ready for the challenge. Their efforts were **painstaking** (ˈpeɪnˌsteɪkɪŋ), requiring patience and precision.

John insisted on maintaining his **dignity** (ˈdɪɡnɪti) throughout the laborious task. The team respected his attitude and worked diligently. The **labor** (ˈleɪbər) was intense, but they knew the importance of the work **undertaken** (ˌʌndərˈteɪkən).

After weeks of hard work, they finally saw the **proof** (pruːf) of their success: a clear, flat path through the once impassable rocks.
