One day, a group of explorers arrived with the goal to <strong>flatten</strong> (ˈflætən) a path through the rocks to make it accessible. However, the rocks were incredibly <strong>unwieldy</strong> (ʌnˈwiːldi), making the task difficult.</p><p>Among the explorers was a man named John, known for his persistence. He often said, &quot;This job is <strong>weird</strong> (wɪrd), but it must be done.&quot; With their tools, they <strong>packed</strong> (pækd) their equipment carefully, ready for the challenge. Their efforts were <strong>painstaking</strong> (ˈpeɪnˌsteɪkɪŋ), requiring patience and precision.</p><p>John insisted on maintaining his <strong>dignity</strong> (ˈdɪɡnɪti) throughout the laborious task. The team respected his attitude and worked diligently. The <strong>labor</strong> (ˈleɪbər) was intense, but they knew the importance of the work <strong>undertaken</strong> (ˌʌndərˈteɪkən).</p><p>After weeks of hard work, they finally saw the <strong>proof</strong> (pruːf) of their success: a clear, flat path through the once impassable rocks.</p><h3 id="wordlist" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#wordlist"><span>Wordlist</span></a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>formation</strong> (fɔːrˈmeɪʃən)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 形成，构造</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: Think of &quot;formation&quot; as something being &quot;formed&quot; into a specific shape or structure.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>flatten</strong> (ˈflætən)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 使变平</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: Think of &quot;flatten&quot; as making something &quot;flat&quot; or level.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>unwieldy</strong> (ʌnˈwiːldi)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 笨重的，不灵便的</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: &quot;Unwieldy&quot; sounds like &quot;unwield&quot; or hard to control, making it difficult to manage.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>weird</strong> (wɪrd)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 奇怪的，怪异的</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: &quot;Weird&quot; often means something out of the ordinary, easy to remember by its odd spelling and meaning.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>pack</strong> (pæk)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 打包，包装</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: Think of &quot;pack&quot; as preparing or putting things into a package.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>painstaking</strong> (ˈpeɪnˌsteɪkɪŋ)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 煞费苦心的，辛苦的</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: &quot;Painstaking&quot; involves &quot;taking pains&quot; or putting in a lot of effort and attention to detail.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>dignity</strong> (ˈdɪɡnɪti)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 尊严，高贵</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: &quot;Dignity&quot; relates to being dignified or having a sense of pride and respect.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>labor</strong> (ˈleɪbər)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 劳动，工作</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: Think of &quot;labor&quot; as hard work or effort, often physical.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>undertaken</strong> (ˌʌndərˈteɪkən)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 承担，从事</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: &quot;Undertaken&quot; means taking on a task or responsibility, literally &quot;under taking&quot; a new challenge.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>proof</strong> (pruːf)</p><ul><li><strong>释义</strong>: 证据，证明</li><li><strong>记忆法</strong>: &quot;Proof&quot; is something that provides evidence or verification of a fact.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="extra" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#extra"><span>extra</span></a></h3><ul><li>diligently</li><li>intense</li></ul>',9),s=[e];function l(a,g){return n(),o("div",null,s)}const d=t(r,[["render",l],["__file","05-22.html.vue"]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/English/daily-words/2024/May/05-22.html","title":"","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"Story","slug":"story","link":"#story","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Wordlist","slug":"wordlist","link":"#wordlist","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"extra","slug":"extra","link":"#extra","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1716519178000,"contributors":[{"name":"RuanCong","email":"1308811723@qq.com","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"English/daily-words/2024/May/05-22.md"}');export{d as comp,h as data};
