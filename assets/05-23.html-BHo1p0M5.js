His laughter was as <strong>spicy</strong> as the jalapeños he juggled, and his antics brought joy to all. However, one day, a <strong>sound</strong> of distress echoed through the streets, marking the <strong>emergence</strong> of a problem. A rumor, <strong>alleged</strong> to be true, spread that the clown&#39;s jokes were no longer funny. To <strong>qualify</strong> for the annual Melodica Carnival, he had to prove otherwise. In a twist of fate, his hopes were nearly <strong>squashed</strong> like a tomato underfoot when he slipped on a banana peel, bending his <strong>spine</strong> in a comical yet alarming fashion. But, with resilience and a dash of humor, he rose, his spirit unbroken, and the crowd erupted in laughter, affirming the timeless adage that sometimes life&#39;s slips lead to the greatest flips.</p><h2 id="vocabulary-list" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary-list"><span>Vocabulary List</span></a></h2><ol><li><p><strong>Sound</strong> [saʊnd]<br><em>Definition:</em> vibrations that travel through the air or another medium and can be heard when they reach a person&#39;s or animal&#39;s ear.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> Think of &quot;surround&quot; to remember the all-encompassing nature of sound.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alleged</strong> [əˈlɛdʒd]<br><em>Definition:</em> said, without proof, to have taken place or to have a specified illegal or undesirable quality.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> &quot;Allege&quot; sounds like &quot;a ledge,&quot; imagine someone making an unproven claim from a high ledge, shouting without evidence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clown</strong> [klaʊn]<br><em>Definition:</em> a comic entertainer, especially one in a circus, wearing a traditional costume and exaggerated makeup.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> Think of the &quot;clown&#39;s crown&quot; to remember the entertainer who is king of making people laugh.</p></li><li><p><strong>Qualify</strong> [ˈkwɑːlɪˌfaɪ]<br><em>Definition:</em> be entitled to a particular benefit or privilege by fulfilling a necessary condition.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> &quot;Qualify&quot; contains &quot;quality,&quot; so think of reaching a certain quality level to qualify.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spicy</strong> [ˈspaɪsi]<br><em>Definition:</em> flavored with or containing strong spices.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> &quot;Spicy&quot; rhymes with &quot;dicey,&quot; which can remind you of taking a risk with hot flavors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emergence</strong> [ɪˈmɜːrdʒəns]<br><em>Definition:</em> the process of becoming visible after being concealed.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> &quot;Emerge&quot; + &quot;ence&quot; - think of an &quot;emergency&quot; where something suddenly needs to emerge or appear.</p></li><li><p><strong>Buoyant</strong> [ˈbɔɪənt]<br><em>Definition:</em> able to stay afloat or rise to the top of a liquid or gas.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> &quot;Buoyant&quot; has &quot;buoy&quot; in it, which is a floating device; think of staying afloat like a buoy in water.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boyish</strong> [ˈbɔɪɪʃ]<br><em>Definition:</em> of or like a boy in a way that is considered typical.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> &quot;Boyish&quot; has &quot;boy&quot; in it; think of the youthful energy and charm typical of boys.</p></li><li><p><strong>Squashed</strong> [skwɑːʃt]<br><em>Definition:</em> crushed or squeezed into a flat shape.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> Sounds like &quot;squished,&quot; which also means compressed; imagine squashing a bug flat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spine</strong> [spaɪn]<br><em>Definition:</em> the series of vertebrae extending from the skull to the lower back, enclosing the spinal cord and providing support for the thorax and abdomen; the backbone.<br><em>Memory Aid:</em> &quot;Spine&quot; sounds like &quot;spike,&quot; which can remind you of the spine&#39;s straight, pointed nature, like a row of spikes supporting the body.</p></li></ol>',6)]))}const u=t(r,[["render",s],["__file","05-23.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/English/daily-words/2024/May/05-23.html","title":"The Buoyant Clown","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Vocabulary List","slug":"vocabulary-list","link":"#vocabulary-list","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1736222561000,"contributors":[{"name":"RuanCong","username":"RuanCong","email":"1308811723@qq.com","commits":2,"url":"https://github.com/RuanCong"}]},"filePathRelative":"English/daily-words/2024/May/05-23.md"}');export{u as comp,m as data};
